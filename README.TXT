                        README FOR RCS SOURCE CODE

                   (This is the GNU source for unix RCS)


     This is the source code to RCS (version 4) for UNIX.  In order to
build the OS/2 specific version of the RCS code, you have to manually
make the changes to each UNIX source file that are outlined in the 
patches.os2 file.  This is the best I can do in providing source for 
the OS/2 version of RCS 4.  It should be clear what to do, but I have 
not done it.  Please upload the converted files after the changes are
made so that they can be shared with others.  

     Also, there is no makefile for MSC provided.  The docs say that
you will need MSC 6.00 and that MSC 5.1 does not work.


Have fun,
Dan Quinlan
